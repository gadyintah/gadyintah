- 👋 Hi, I’m @gadyintah a.k.a. "Japanese" on most every platform even in gaming.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding but is very slow so please excuse my inability to learn fast.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++, java, and php. I'm also willing to learn js, python, and the basics of api.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple codes for mastery of the basics in programming.
- 📫 You can email me through jikiorejo1@gmail.com if you want to help me learn. Thank you ^_^
